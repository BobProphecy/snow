  description: "This pipeline graph provides insights into the top 15 customers with\
    \ the highest total sales. By joining the 'HW_ORDERS' table from the 'BOBW.HELLOWORLD'\
    \ source with the 'CUSTOMER' table from the 'SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA.TPCH_SF10'\
    \ source, it combines order and customer information. The resulting dataset includes\
    \ details such as order ID, customer ID, order status, order category, order date,\
    \ amount, customer name, customer address, customer phone number, customer account\
    \ balance, customer market segment, and customer comments. By summarizing the\
    \ total sales for each customer and ordering them in descending order, businesses\
    \ can identify their top-performing customers and tailor their marketing and sales\
    \ strategies accordingly."
